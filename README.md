# pctochat

yet another browser-based pictochat clone that works on lan

itâ€™s not an exact clone though; it was never intended to be one

## welcome back, download play!!!

only one person has to download the program so that everyone in the same network can access it using their browser!!!

everyone on the internet can access it too if you forward the chosen port (2004 by default) on your router's configuration

## build

use `pyinstaller` to create the binaries for better portability. use the build configurations on the `spec` files
